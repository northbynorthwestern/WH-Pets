Champ’s name holds emotional significance for Joe Biden, as his father often said to him, “Get up, champ.” Major was adopted from the Delaware Humane Association a few months before Biden announced his bid for presidency and will be the first shelter dog to live in the White House. In late November, Biden fractured his foot after slipping while playing with Major.">

W. Bush and George W. Bush. She’s also the author of “Millie’s Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush,” which details a day in her life with the president and the first lady. The Hill reported that George H. W. Bush was worried about the weight of his English Springer Spaniel named Ranger, prompting him to write a letter to White House staff asking offices to pledge not to feed Ranger and for Ranger to wear a “Do not feed me” badge along with his ID.">

It was a little cocker spaniel dog in a crate that he’d sent all the way from Texas, black and white, spotted. And our little girl Tricia, the 6-year-old, named it Checkers … Regardless of what they say about it, we’re gonna keep it.” In what is now known as the “Checkers Speech,” Richard Nixon introduced to the nation the one political gift he would keep: his new dog. In the same speech, he vehemently denied accusations of using a secret campaign trust fund to fund his political expenses. Checkers never actually lived in the White House because Nixon only had her while he was senator and vice president.">
